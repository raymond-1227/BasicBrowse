# BasicBrowse

## About

I tried learning about what is .NET Framework and C#, so I coded and designed this browser.
You are free to use this software anyways.

## Source Code

Please [click here](https://github.com/raymond-1227/BasicBrowse) for the source code.

## Overview

It doesn't have much things to do with. Here's a screenshot for the browser itself.
