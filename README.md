# BasicBrowse

## About

I tried learning about what is .NET Framework and C#, so I coded and designed this browser.
The browser is powered by CefSharp, which is a Chromium based framework to make browsers.
Tabs powered by EasyTabs, making it having a nice looking old style Chrome-like tabs.

## Overview

It doesn't have much things to do with. Here's a screenshot for the browser itself.

## Future Updates

- Add a better icon instead of the default and the icon seemed like it's made in 2005. (well it's made in 2020)
- Make the browser not to store browse histories (well even it stores but you still can't search the history)
