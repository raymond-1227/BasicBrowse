# BasicBrowse

## About

I tried learning about what is .NET Framework and C#, so I coded and designed this browser.
The browser is powered by CefSharp, which is a Chromium based framework to make browsers.
Tabs powered by EasyTabs, making it having a nice looking old style Chrome-like tabs.

## Overview

It doesn't have much things to do with. Here's a screenshot for the browser itself.
